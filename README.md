# 🌦️ AI-Powered Weather Forecast



## 🚀 About the Project

An AI-driven weather forecasting tool that analyzes past weather data to predict future rainfall and temperature trends. Using historical data from the Bet Dagan weather station, this model forecasts the weather for the next 7 days and provides insights into daily trends (morning, afternoon, evening, night).

## 🔍 Features

- 📊 **Historical Weather Analysis**: Fetches past weather data (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.)
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Predictions**: Uses a Random Forest model to predict rainfall probabilities for the next week
- 🕒 **Time-of-Day Breakdown**: Divides daily data into morning, afternoon, evening, and night trends
- 📈 **Data Visualization (Upcoming Feature!)**: Plan to add visual charts for weather trends

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data processing
- **Meteostat** for weather data retrieval
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning (Random Forest Classifier)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast-ai.git
cd weather-forecast-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python weatherforecast.py
```

## 📡 Data Sources

Weather data is fetched from the **Meteostat API**, using historical records from the Bet Dagan weather station.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 📊 **Graphical UI** for visualizing predictions
- 🌍 **Support for Multiple Locations**
- 🌧️ **Better Rainfall Prediction Models** with Deep Learning
